## IOOS QARTOD & OOI QC Procedures

Leila Belabbassi, GCOOS

## Abstract
QARTOD (Quality Assurance / Quality Control of Real-Time Oceanographic Data) are automated tests intended for real-time observations that are delivered without delay, a time check defined by the time interval set in the sensor configuration. For Ocean Observatories Initiatives (OOI), QARTOD may apply to telemetered data ingested into the cyberinfrastructure in real-time. This is not implemented in the cyberinfrastructure, rather it is a projected goal that OOI QC procedures will meet the IOOS QARTOD standards. The OOI automated QC algorithms were derived from passed observatories experiences and designed for both real-time (collected by telemetry) and delayed-mode (collected after sensor recovery) data. So, there is a lot to learn from OOI if the QC test are monitored and tailored to work with the large number of instrument types and the large set of data parameters the OOI system hosts. In this presentation, I will use the opportunity to point out the overlap that exists between QARTOD and OOI QC tests and some of the difficulties encountered in applying QC flags and summarizing and reporting QC results.
